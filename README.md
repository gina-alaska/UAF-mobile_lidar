UAF Mobile Lidar
================

Possible route for a mobile LiDAR collection on UAF campus by Aerometric.

Data delivered would be fairly raw - and not geo referenced - so relatively accurate but
more work would be required to properly pin it to the ground.

This is offered by Aerometric to UAF for free a sample research product for evaluation.

Thanks to [James Wilder](http://bloglidar.com/) from [Aerometric](http://www.aerometric.com/services) for this offer.
